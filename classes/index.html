A second and third sequence is led by the teacher while encouraging and creating space for the student to freely move his or her own body in its own innate rhythm.

The teacher will encourage the students to maintain that deeper, full belly breath, while letting go, and softening the body, allowing the student to breathe deeper into the pose, and promoting a deeper stretch. This allows the student to not only soften the muscles, but begins to retrain the connective tissue as well, changing the dynamics of the body.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-hk=00000007000200060 class="_class_1z0h4_1"><div class="_class-image_1z0h4_11"><img src="/classes_vin_yin.jpg"></div><div class="_class-descripiton_1z0h4_11"><div><h2>Vin/Yin</h2><div class="copy"><p>Students will begin in a restorative pose as the teacher leads students to cultivate a deep, diaphragmatic breath.
